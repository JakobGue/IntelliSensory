For this program to work you need to add a "Credentials.h" file.
This file has to include the following:

#define MQTT_HOST ""
#define MQTT_PORT 
#define MQTT_USER ""
#define MQTT_PASSWORD ""
#define DEBUG_HOST ""
#define DEBUG_PORT 
#define DEBUG_USER ""
#define DEBUG_PASSWORD ""
#define MODE "" 

MODE has the two options: "DESK" and "HEATER"
